## What it does
Books4Cooks is a **website** that allows users to upload and share recipes they know with their friends, as well as add recipes from other users and published cookbooks to their own personal 'books.' Users can search the extensive database of partnered cookbooks, as well as user-uploaded recipes, and filter by cook time, ingredients, allergens, and difficulty level to add their perfectly customizable collection of recipes. 
Sleek and easy to navigate, Books4Cooks consists of a homepage where users can look through published recipes. The database of recipes comes from published cookbooks (for our prototype, the two books it draws from are ones we created) and user-created recipes. Users can then easily access their own 'Cookbooks', which contain recipes they've uploaded and ones they've saved, from the home bar across the page.

## How we built it
We coded the website with HTML and CSS for the front-facing aspects and used a combination of Python and Javascript for the backend. 

## Challenges we ran into
We could never quite figure out how to connect the database/API and the front end.....

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Before this event, **none of our members had ever built a website before**, so to create something this complex feels monumental. We're so so proud of what we've accomplished and are thrilled to have finished what we did.

## What's next for Books4Cooks
We'd like to emphasize the social aspect of Books4Cooks and create a 'Friends' tab, where you can see what your friends have recently saved. Additionally, we'd love to add a feature where you can mark recipes as "made", where you can mark that you've made a certain recipe in your book, and notate any changes you made.
